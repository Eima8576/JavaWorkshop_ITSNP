// Task 4: - Declare two variables using let on the same line without terminating the line and store true value in both the variables and perform addition and show the result on the console and try to analyze the code.

let a = true , b = true ;
let sum = a + b ;
console.log(sum);

//we assigned true to both variables which returns 1 so the sum is 2
//if we've assigned false it would have returned 0
